  salutation: `I am an Email/Frontend Developer with a keen eye for building responsive, user-centred email/websites from a PSD, Figma or mockup.
  My passion for coding has led me to work with basic web technologies, sophisticated frameworks, and libraries on multiple projects of different sizes.
  The favorite part of my job is the process of taking an idea and bringing it to life, through both web design and development techniques.
  As a developer, I enjoy the opportunity to be challenged every day with new technologies and projects that require me to solve problems and develop my logical thinking.
  I also enjoy collaborating with others to efficiently and effectively produce solutions.`
